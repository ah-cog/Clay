# Pixel, Assembly and Test Process

## Meanings of symbols used in this document

- means solder from the bottom side (e.g., for connecting to subsequent layer)
+ means solder from the top side (e.g., from previous layer)
* means solder from both the top and bottom sides


## General suggestions and tips (i.e., protocol):	

- Apply Krazy Glue to single headers (and other headers) after soldering and tested successfully to make stronger.
	- Glue the power switch and battery connectors on the Life layer after teseting them for continuity. Also glue down the traces leading to the battery connector. Make the battery connectors as secure as possible.


## Movement

- (-5x) Headers for IMU

>>> Solder Movement layer onto Life layer

- Connect IMU to headers (Auxiliary step)

- Upload and verify IMU functionality
- Continuity test Wi-Fi shield paths (before continuing to Stimulus layer)

## Stimulus

### Before soldering to the Movement layer:

(*1x Via) Via below speaker for speaker (+)
Speaker (push flush with board)
(-2x) Two below speaker between LED holes
(-1x) One diagonal (up and left) from the previous two
(-1x) Bottom right
(-1x) Top right
(-7x) Right side, for Wi-Fi module
(*3x) Bottom right, flush with bottom, for 90 degree headers for LED module
(*3x) Bottom left, flush with bottom, for 90 degree headers for LED module
(*3x) Top right, flush with bottom, for 90 degree headers for LED module
(*3x) Top left, flush with bottom, for 90 degree headers for LED module

After testing all connections with their source on the Order layer, solder the Stimulus layer onto the Movement layer.

### After soldering to the Movement layer:

(+1x) Bottom left (left-most of all)
(+1x) Bottom left, diagonal up and right from previous
(+1x) Top right, from previous layer's GND
(+3x) Bottom right, above bottom LED module's right (from this orientation) set of connectors
(+1x) Top and right WRT speaker, near the speaker
(+1x) Top and left WRT speaker, near the speaker (but less so than previous), for LED module's signal
(+3x) Top right cluster for and near the right set of headers for the top right LED module

Test the speaker.

(1x) Solder the bottom LED module onto the bottom right-angle headers.
(1x) Solder the top LED module onto the top right-angle headers.

Test the light. With gesture.

Test the connections that that go to the top layer. Glue any that can be glued.

# Thoughts

- Looking at computation (and its computer substrate) as materials could be a healthy perspective, from an ecological perspective. As a material, this is not all good. It's poisonous for people, can potentially push you towards madness, and can harm the environment. It's got lead in it.
