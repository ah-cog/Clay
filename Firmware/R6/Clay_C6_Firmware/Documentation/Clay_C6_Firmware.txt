   - LED1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.

                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - LED1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a

                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt_LDD)
   - TI1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "I2C0"      (component I2C_LDD)
   - I2C0_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - I2C0_MasterSendBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes inclusive 
                of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The slave address must be 
                specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, "Target slave 
                address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The 
                state of transmission is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete or OnError). Data to be sent are 
                not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer 
                should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockSent"can be used to detect the 
                end of the transmission. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - I2C0_MasterReceiveBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes 
                inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and then receives the block of characters from the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, 
                "Target slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that reception was 
                successful. The state of reception is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete  or OnError). Data to 
                be received are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of 
                the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockReceived"can be used 
                to detect the end of the reception. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - I2C0_SelectSlaveDevice -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave, 10-bit address or general 
                call value. Any send or receive method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected

                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - LED_SDB_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - LED_SDB_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).

                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - BuzzerSwitch_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - BuzzerSwitch_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to 
                a memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using

                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - ADC0_StartSingleMeasurement -This method starts one measurement of the selected group of samples and exits immediately. 
                This is ADC SW trigger method. The group of samples for measurement is specified by preceding call to 
                <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is 
                invoked after the measurement is done and if the event is enabled. Results of the measurement can be read by 
                the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from configured ADC is enabled automatically. 
                The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested number of results are transferred to 
                destination buffer by DMA and if the event is enabled. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is not available if DMA 
                mode is enabled. If the DMA transfer was completed before and DMA is not recofingured, DMA error can occur. See 
                also <SetBuffer()> method.     The state of the measurement can be also polled by the 
                <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method. The <Discontinuous mode> doesn't support this method.
   - ADC0_GetMeasuredValues -This method copies results of the last measurement to the user supplied buffer. Data size depends 
                on the size of measured sample group (see <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup()> method). Data 
                representation is defined by the <Result type> property. Typically this method is called from 
                <OnMeasurementComplete> event to get results of the last measurement. This method is not available if DMA is 
                enabled.
   - ADC0_SelectSampleGroup -This method selects one of the (design-time) predefined <Static sample groups> for the next 
                measurement. Each call rewrites the preceding setting. Once any group is selected, the measurement can be 
                started multiple times. Note: This method works only with the sample groups defined at design time. For 
                run-time defined groups use <CreateSampleGroup()> method.
   - ADC0_CreateSampleGroup -This method prepares HW for next measurement according to array of samples defined during run-time.
                The array of samples should be prepared prior to calling this method. Pointer to the array is passed into this 
                method in parameter SampleGroupPtr. The number of samples is defined by parameter SampleCount. Once any group 
                is prepared, the measurement can be started multiple times. Note: This method works only with the sample groups 
                defined during run-time. For design-time defined groups use <SelectSampleGroup()> method.
   - ADC0_GetMeasurementCompleteStatus -Returns whether the measurement is done and the results can be read by the user. It can 
                be used to poll the state of measurement if <Interrupt service/event> is disabled or if <OnMeasurementComplete> 
                event is disabled by the <SetEventMask()> methods.
   - ADC0_StartCalibration -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of 
                the gain and offset from a specific reading.
   - ADC0_GetCalibrationResultStatus -This method should be used for check the last calibration result. If calibration 
                completed normally the method finish calibration process by writing gain calibration values.

Module "ButtonIn"  (component GPIO_LDD)
   - ButtonIn_Init -This method initializes the associated peripheral(s) and the component internal variables. The method is 
                called automatically as a part of the application initialization code.
   - ButtonIn_GetPortValue -This method returns the current port input data value. Only configured pins (through all of bit 
                fields in this component) are returned.
   - ButtonIn_SetFieldValue -This method sets the output data value of the specified bit field.
   - ButtonIn_GetFieldValue -This method returns the current input data of the specified field.
   - ButtonIn_ClearFieldBits -This method drives the specified bits of the specified bit field to the inactive level.
   - ButtonIn_SetFieldBits -This method drives the specified bits of the specified bit field to the active level.

                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - PowerOn_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - PowerOn_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "MESH_SPI"  (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - MESH_SPI_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" 
                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second 
                call of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - MESH_SPI_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> 
                to check the end of data transmission or method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - MESH_SPI_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the 
                specified number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running 
                receive operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation 
                has already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of 
                data call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.
   - MESH_SPI_GetBlockReceivedStatus -This method returns whether the receiver is finished reception of all data block. The 
                status flag is accumulated, after calling this method the status is returned and cleared (set to "false" state).

                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - ESP8266_Serial_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is 
                not completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled. This method finishes immediately after calling it - it 
                doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> to check the end of data transmission or 
                method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - ESP8266_Serial_ReceiveBlock -Specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has 
                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.
