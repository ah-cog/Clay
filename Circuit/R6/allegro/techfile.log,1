Technology Difference Report
============================

Design        : CLAYR6
Input File    : E:/git/clay/Circuit/R6/allegro_settings/clay_tech.tcf
Update Mode   : Merge (no deletions will be done)
Constraint Information : CrossSection, Electrical, Physical, Spacing, Same Net Spacing, Properties
Notes:
------
  - Attribute updates are reported as additions, deletions, or changes.
  - Association updates are reported as additions or deletions. Associations
    are the members of a MatchGroup, Constraint Set references, the PinPairs
    of a Net, the members of a Differential Pair, etc.
  - Clearing an object implies that the object does not exist so all attributes
    and associations for the object will be deleted. These attribute and association
    deletions are not included in the Summary totals. Objects are Constraint Sets,
    Buses, XNets, Nets, etc.
