Setting up BOM for P1R5
Took first parts, through line 95, from the bom-ex sample project. Use them as a template.
Add part information from the vendor/manufacturer website as shown in earlier entries to 
    work with bom-ex. Use vendor-specific (mouser, digikey) databases.
Read info in bom-ex manual about exporting BOMs.
